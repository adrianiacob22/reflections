During this first Lesson 
 - I learned how to setup git environment.
 - I also learned how to use basic git commands
	- git clone --> used to clone a git repository - eiter local or remote
	- git diff --> used to view differences between git commits
	- git log --> used to see git logs, basically to list git commits and their commentsin order to help debugging
	- git checkout --> used to switch to another commit (older or newer) in order to see what changed and how
 	- git commit --> used to commit the update done 

Also, I had to debug some issues in an example code.
All actions were done using git commands above.
