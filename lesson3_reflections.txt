Lesson 3
When would you like to create a remote repository rather than keeping it local?
  I would create a remote repository when more users are contributing to the same work.
  I would also create one when I need to share it with other people.

List remote repos
git remote

Add remote repos
git remote add origin https://url/path

 - origin is the name of the remote I want to push

git push origin master

 - this will push to the remote origin, which has my remote repo added, the local branch master.
