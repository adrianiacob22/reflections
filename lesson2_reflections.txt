What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git directory gets created. 
I need git repository to track changes on my files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
git add and git status are both working on staging area and are working before commits.
Staging area is not persistent. it can be easily reverted back without keeping a log about it.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
Use "git add" to add a file to staging area that you will be able to commit later.
Staging area is a copy of the most recent commit, until I add changes to it.
To compare Staging area with theworking directory use git diff with no arguments.
git diff

git diff --staged --> Will compare staging area with the most recent commit.
